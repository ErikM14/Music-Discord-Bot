This is a Discord Bot created by Erik Michael, West Chester University of PA, 2021.
Made using Python, Discord.py API, youtube-search-python library, and REPL.it online IDE.

•The purpose of this bot was to learn more about Discord.py API, practice Python, and create something I could see myself using.

•Available commands so far:
  1. $go "song/video name" - will return the top result for the title
  2. $random - will play a random song stored in the database that you added
  3. $add "song/video name" - allows you to add a song to database that can be called with the $random command. Will provide a successfully added statement on Discord.

•Features I plan to add:
  1. Command to print out song names that are stored in the database
  2. Command to show numerous video names/urls for the user to choose from
  3. Command to choose index in the database to have that specific song played
  4. More to come...
